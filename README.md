## **C# Training Camp Projects**

This repository contains the projects I completed during the C# Training Camp under the guidance of Murat YÃ¼cedaÄŸ. Each project provided an opportunity to practice and enhance essential programming concepts. Below are brief summaries of the projects:

ðŸŒŸ Projects:

ðŸš€ **1-Hello World!**

   I learned how to print text to the console and understood the structure of a C# program.

ðŸš€ **2-Variables**

   I focused on using data types (e.g., int, string, double) and working with variables.

ðŸš€ **3-Arrays**

   I started using arrays to store multiple values and process them using loops.

ðŸš€ **4-Conditional Statements (If-Else)**

   I implemented if-else structures to make programs behave differently based on conditions.

ðŸš€ **5-Loops**

   I simplified repetitive tasks by using for, while, and foreach loops.

ðŸš€ **6-Methods**

   I wrote parameterized and returnable methods to make code more organized and reusable.

ðŸš€ **7-Foreach and Exam System**

   I created a system to calculate student grades using the foreach loop.

ðŸš€ **8-Functions with Return Values**

   I worked with methods that process user input and return results.

ðŸš€ **9- Database-Based Product-Category System**

   I used SqlConnection and SqlCommand classes to retrieve and list data from a database.

ðŸ”§ Key Learnings:

   Gained hands-on experience with core C# programming concepts.

   Practiced database connections and SQL operations.

   These projects provided a strong foundation for advancing my C# knowledge and tackling more complex projects in the future!
